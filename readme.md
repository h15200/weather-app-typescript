# node, js, css weather app

## Set up

run server.js
open port 3000

## Description

Exercise - use vanilla js for front and back end.
No express, no react

Was able to set up TS build but not using it in this project.

Next project - think about file structure, use dist/ so you know where the complied js codes go
